I drew my first comic when I was around 5 years old.

I had never watched the Swamp Thing television show (I wasn’t allowed), but I was transfixed by the commercials on TV and toys advertised in the Sunday paper.  <!--more-->  These figures were bent and gnarled around the edges, not like the simplified, bulbous lines of the Ninja Turtles cartoons and not obviously heroic  like my clean-cut, all-American G.I. Joes action figures.  I would only recognize years later the grim aesthetic that attracted me to the ideas of Swamp Thing was probably the gothic horror I still love and appreciate today. Approachable monsters; probably how I coped with being imaginative /and/ a scaredy-cat.

I turned all that pent-up enthusiasm for what I imagined the show to be into a comic book (though I don’t know if I’d ever read any comics at the time). Every page was a splash page, maybe one inset panel for a reaction, with the word balloons of 1-to-3 lines of dialog. Dad “read” my comic to me before I went to sleep, improvising 90% of the dialog (I was only 5), and turning a climatic battle of mossy titans to a Who’s On First farce, with Swamp Thing yanking one of the evil monsters around by the eye-stalk.

I continued to make comics through high school. I forgot the gothic heroes They were predominantly high fantasy and superhero comics. When it came time to pick a college,  I couldn’t  afford Joe Kubert’s School of Sequential Art (but hey, weren’t those ads incredible?) and went to a local community college instead.  I met Jay at my first day of college, in fact. We were in the same program for the same reasons; we wanted to make comics, but figured we might want to have a fallback too. Graphic design. Just as print was dying, wouldn’t you know. We started an anthology with others in the program a year or so later and continued making comics now through 16 years of friendship. About a year ago, he called me up; “Hey,” he said, “remember that comic we tried making years ago? About the woman and the aliens and Art Bell? Why don’t we make that, like a full, proper, long comic.”

So here we are.

While print did really did go the way of the black rhino (not dead, but definitely diminished), I got a job at an agency where I ended up designing and coding website templates.  I got to evolve with the web, as they went from static to dynamic, to applications and eventually found myself doing code and design for web products. I’m still in love with the web, probably as much as I am with comics. The internet connection you’re on, with the browser you’ve got amounts to a flexible, organic canvas, capable of morphing to fit every screen and delivering all kinds of media.  What better canvas could a comics writer ask for?  This project, on the technical side, is actually the culmination of a lot of experiments I’ve been running over the years.

So that brings us to here and now. Abducted is approximately 50% written and drawn. We have one issue launched, with another on the way next month, and a series of mix-tapes, podcasts, and blog posts planned. This is the longest thing we’ve collaborated on. This is the most ambitious thing I’ve done.

I’m excited to share what I learn along the way, maybe letting this site stand as a collected trade, sound track and directors’s commentary all to boot. What if we could make comics be even more without forcing it into the conventions of other genres, or optimize for other platforms and advertising. The templates I’ve made for this project will be open sourced, and I’ll be publishing all the gritty details of my experiments here, hopefully for everyone’s benefits.

Let’s make some comics.
