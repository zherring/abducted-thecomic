              <aside class="typewr gray">By Zach on 15 February, 2019</aside>

              <p>I drew my first comic when I was around 5 years old.</p>

<p>I had never watched the Swamp Thing television show (I wasn’t allowed), but I was transfixed by the commercials on TV and toys advertised in the Sunday paper.  <!--more-->  The shapes these figures cut were bent and gnarled around the edges, not like the simplified, bulbous lines of the Ninja Turtles cartoons. There was no obvious hero, like my clean-cut, all-American G.I. Joes action figures either. And I’d only recognize years later that the grim aesthetic that attracted me to the ideas of Swamp Thing was probably the gothic horror I still love and appreciate today. Approachable monsters; probably how I coped with being imaginative <em>and</em> a scaredy-cat.</p>

<p>Being denied the opportunity to satiate my obsession with consuming, I turned all that pent-up enthusiasm into a comic book (though I don’t know if I’d ever read any comics at the time). Every page was a splash page, maybe one inset panel for a reaction, with the word balloons of 1-to-3 lines of dialog. Dad “read” my comic to me before I went to sleep, improvising 90% of the dialog (I was only 5), and turning a climatic battle of mossy titans to a Who’s On First farce, Swamp Thing dragging one of the evil monsters around by the eye-stalk despite much protesting. Accessible, yet, monsterous.</p>

<p>I continued to make comics through high school. I substituted the gothic maybe-heroes of age 5 for high fantasy paladins and my own flavor of superheroes. When it came time to pick a college,  I couldn’t  afford Joe Kubert’s School of Sequential Art (but hey, weren’t those ads incredible?) and went to a local community college instead.  I met Jay at my first day of college, in fact. We were in the same program for the same reasons; we wanted to make comics, but figured we might want to have a fallback too. Graphic design. Just as print was “dying,” wouldn’t you know. We started an anthology with others in the program a year or so later and continued making comics together through our 16 years of friendship.</p>

<p>About a year ago, he called me up. “Hey,” he said, “remember that comic we tried making years ago? About the woman and the aliens and AM Radio? Why don’t we make that, like a full, proper, long comic.”</p>

<p>So here we are.</p>

<p>While print really did go the way of the black rhino (not dead, definitely diminished), I got a job at a design agency where I ended up designing and coding website templates.  I’d started coding fan-sites on Tripod before, and so ended up getting to evolve <em>with</em> the web; as it went from static to dynamic, dynamic to interactive and finally full blown applications, I  eventually found myself doing code and design for web products. I’m still in love with the web I discovered on Tripod, probably as much as I am with comics I discovered at the grocery store. The browser we have amounts to a flexible, organic canvas, capable of morphing to fit every screen and delivering all kinds of media.  What better medium could a comics writer ask for?  This project, on the technical side, is the culmination of a lot of experiments I’ve been running over the years.</p>

<p>So that brings us to here and now. Abducted is approximately 50% written and drawn. We have one issue launched, with another on the way next month, and a series of mixtapes, podcasts, and blog posts planned. This is the longest thing we’ve collaborated on. This is the most ambitious thing I’ve done.</p>

<p>I’m excited to share what I learn along the way, maybe letting this site stand as a collected trade, soundtrack and directors’s commentary all to boot. We’re here to experiment with the sequential medium without without forcing it into the conventions of film, or optimize for other platforms and advertising. The templates I’ve made for this project will be open sourced, and I’ll be publishing all the gritty details of my experiments here, hopefully for everyone’s benefits.</p>

<p>Let’s make some comics.</p>
